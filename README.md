# Classifying-phishing-sites-using-machine-learning
Phishing is a type of online crime in which an attacker disguises as a reputable entity or person and trying to alert individuals into reaching their fake websites in the hope that they are trying to tricked into providing sensitive data about themselves. Emails or websites are the main channels through which attackers try to acquire unauthorized access to information of the user which is sensitive in nature. In recent times, due to phishing attacks financial losses were there to many individuals. So the various types of data that can be collected by phishers if one falls for a phishing attack are your credentials, passwords, usernames, personal data such as name, addresses, treatment information such as medical records and insurance claims. It is hard to recognize how dangerous that would be if that information falls into wrong hands. Traditional methods such as rule based have been not so effective in detecting phishing url, as in today’s world, hackers been have trying various techniques to lure the targeted users. In this paper we have proposed the types of bagging and boosting techniques such as Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Bagging classifier. We have used the various feature extraction techniques to feed the algorithms in an attempt to achieve higher accuracy. The purpose of this project is to help individuals to identify these phishing url in order to provide safer practices online. 








Aims and Objectives:
The research aim is to investigate different supervised Ml models to detect sites which are phishing. In order to address this research aim, Researcher framed the questions which are as follows:
R1: How we can use Ml supervised models for classification of legitimate and malicious websites?
R2: How to evaluate performance of models which we used to classify websites?
R3: How feature selection algorithm can be used to come up with most important features that helps in classifying phishing sites?
On one side, Research question 1 and Research question 3 helps in developing a Machine learning based models to detect phishing sites for securing a network. On the other hand, Research question 2 states the significance of evaluation of performance of a phishing technique.
Additionally, a number of achievable and time constrained objectives will be take in account in order to realize the research goal. The following are:
•	To review different feature selection algorithms such as Information Gain, Recursive feature elimination, gain ratio to come up with most important features.
•	To compare different ML supervised algorithms such as Decision tree, random forest, xgboost and bagging classifier on a combination of different features.
•	To review different performance metrics such as recall, precision, accuracy for assessing the performance of all models.
